### Informal Response 2

##### One of the first steps towards teaching a computer "how to see" is splitting the data into two groups, a set of training images and training labels and then also a set of test images and test labels. Why is this done? What is the purpose of splitting the data into a training set and a test set?
Splitting data into a training set and a test set is important because it can test the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm without any unnecessary bias. Having the testing data be from the same dataset the computer learned makes sure that all images in the testing set will correspond to similar images and the same labels as the testing group. If the data was tested on the same data it was trained on, it would be similar to a student memorizing the answer key instead of taking similar practice tests.
